Description
-----------

So you’ve written a kick-ass application in a kick-ass programming framework which captures a super complicated business process that nearly kicked your ass.  Fast-forward two years…. Your MVC framework came out with version 2, and you need to upgrade but that super complicated business logic is stuck inside Version 1.

In this presentation we will cover some aspects of Domain Driven Design that will help you program in way that will decouple your Business Logic from your framework and environment.  Along the way we’ll get to talk about some pitfalls in MVC and really cool sounding things like Hexagonal Architecture.
